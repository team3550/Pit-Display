              <h2> Gemini</h2>
              <p> This year's robot, named Gemini, features mechanisms to pick up and place blocks in the baskets, and sensors to detect the IR beacon.
                    To pick up blocks, the robot drives into the corner, and scoops up to 4 blocks into the "bucket".  The bucket is mounted onto a telescoping
                    lift, and tilts up and down to store and dump blocks.  To detect the IR beacon, the robot drives parallel to the baskets in Autonomous mode, 
                    and when it passes the beacon, flips out an arm to dump the preloaded block into the basket.  The robot then continues to drive to the end of
                    the field and parks on the bridge.</p>

              <h2> CAD design</h2>
              <p>  Gemini was completely designed in CAD before fabricating parts, and the model serves as a design plan for the season.  The model started out as a basic
                    skeleton of sketches to see how different components would interact, and allow us to dynamically change the design.  Then, each part was modeled or imported to create a final design for analysis.
                    With this analysis, we were able to determine an approximate weight of the robot (25 lbs), where the center of gravity was located, and were able to make
                    changes to the design by altering the underlying skeleton model.</p>

              <h2> Scouting App</h2>
              <p> In addition to the robot, we also design a scouting application to keep track of teams and their robots during the competition.  This application is
                  based on HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript so that it is device-agnostic, and is able to run in any HTML5 capable browser.  This allows us to distribute
                  the application to multiple devices without coding for any specific device, and will allow us in the future to create more powerful capabilities.
                  The application is still in the works, and will gain more features as the season progresses</p>

              <h2> This display</h2>
              <p>  As a result of creating and designing The Yellow Alliance, and the web-based Scouting app, we decided to apply our newly gained knowledge and skills to this display,
                   which is actually a locally hosted webpage.  This webpage display runs off of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and a Bootstrap CSS plugin, allowing us to create a display
                   that fits in a pocket, and can be rendered by any device that has a HTML5 capable web browser</p>
