              , <b>Nerd Herd</b>, and <b>Panda X-Press</b>.  We helped them with various programming issues and helped most of them get a robot up and running for the first time.</p>

              <h2>West Des Moines, an FTC Legacy</h2>
              <p> Over the past 9 years, we have worked hard to build an FTC legacy in the West Des Moines area.  Seven years ago, no FIRST programs existed in the area, and it has
                  since grown to 8 FTC teams, and 1 FRC team.  Support for the FIRST programs is finally beginning to emerge in the school district, 
                  and Beta is continuing to work towards creating a sustainable FIRST community for future students.</p>

              <h2> Beginnings of a STEM Center</h2>
              <p> In June, members of Beta, community leaders, and key individuals from the city met to begin plans for a STEM center that would support the local FIRST teams,
                  provide opportunities for other STEM programs, and create connections with a Makerspace.  Since then, we have visited a potential space
                  to house the STEM center, and have continued developments to realize these plans.</p>

              <p> The Yellow Alliance is an in-progress database of all FTC teams and all FTC matches as the 2013-14 Block Party! season progresses.
                This is a collaborative effort between Beta, and FTC Iowa to provide useful information and statistics as the season progresses,
                and to provide metrics on how the game is changing over the season.  Data is uploaded from the Scoring System at every event, and the database will grow
                as the season progresses, providing data and information like FRC's "<i>The Blue Alliance</i>".</p>

              <p> After the World Championships in April, we were requested by US FIRST to create an example Judge's Interview video for other teams to model after.  
                  The judging panel included the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Reynolds, and was posted by U.S. FIRST on Youtube for all teams to view.</p>

              <p> On Aug. 22nd, four members from our team visited a local FLL team in Urbandale, to talk with them about an Engineering Notebook.  We shared our
                   notebook from the previous season, and some information on how to write entries.  Then, to promote hands-on-learning, we designed mini-challenge
                   to simulate a competition season, and had them keep track of their "mini-season" in their notebook.</p>

                  presented on LabView basics, and Mr. Herzberg and Saketh help a hands-on prototyping workshop/information session.</p>

             <h2> Drivetrain Comparisons</h2>
             <p> In order to compare a four wheel chassis to a six wheel chassis with dropped center, I created a prototyping platform using the older Lego RCXs. 
				 In order to compare the drivetrains side-by-side, and video was compiled from several different tests, and the results are very dramatic.
				 This video was published to youtube so that other teams could observe the differences in drivetrains, and understand the advantages of 
				 six driven wheels with the center wheel dropped.</p>
