              <h2> Asia-Pacific Invitational</h2>
              <p> At the World Championships, we were invited by the affiliate partner for FIRST Australia to attend the Asia-Pacific FTC Invitational in Sydney, Australia.
                  In Sydney, we had the amazing opportunity to connect with teams from all around the world, and were able to experience a competition in a multi-cultural
                  setting.  Not only did we compete at API, but we also held a presentation on the Inspire award, and what it means, for the attending teams.  We made it to
                  the finals in the robot matches, and won the Inspire award at this off-season competition</p>

              <h2>Australia <i>"Night Under the Stars"</i></h2>
              <p> On May 17th, we again set up connections with our partners in Australia to drive robots remotely.  However, this time, the drivers would be in Sydney,
                  Australia and would be driving a robot 9,000 miles away in our Coach's basement.  This was part of a FIRST promotional booth at an Astronomy event in Sydney.
                  The FRC team <b>Thunder Down Under</b> helped us set up connections and themed their booth as Astronaut robot training for the younger kids attending.  As part
                  of their booth, kids got to drive a robot on "Mars", and the line to drive robots went past the door at their venue. </p>

              <h2> Press Conference w/ Lt. Governor</h2>
              <p> Because of our relations with the Lieutenant Governor, we were invited to speak at one of her press conferences, and spread the word about FIRST.
                  We talked about what the FIRST program is, how it impacts students, how it has impacted our own lives, and our team at the World Championships.
                  This was an amazing opportunity to be a part of the press conference for the Lieutenant Governor, and many of the people there were engaged and asked questions.</p>

              <p> After winning the most honourable Inspire Award at the World Championships, our city awarded the team with a Key to the City.  The city recognized our
                  accomplishments over the past 4 years, and recognized the community that we have begun to establish in the area.</p>

              <h2> Connect Iowa video</h2>
              <p> In the off-season, we were contacted by the Connect Iowa initiative to feature in a video for their campaign.  Connect Iowa has set out
                  to provide broadband access to all areas of Iowa, and wanted to include us in their video for our work on the Tele-Connection pilot project.
                  This video was released to the public in September, and is helping to spread the word of FIRST.</p>
